I plan to add a few extra features to this program. Currently in python, I simply used some common libararies such as PyQt5 and pyautogui which made this project allot easier I have to say. PyQt5 is amazing and you can do pretty much anything with it.
This is one of the very first projects i completed and helped me get more familiar with syntax and how to use variables. Nothing to serious, and you can even tweak the size of the windows or upload images as long your images are in the same directory as your .py file.
Another cool tip is this QTthread libary which helped me with the timing of the mouse jiggler.
With all that being said, I plan to add a window icon and figure out a way to convert this into a .exe.
Currently to run the .py file you will need Spyder, or some other Python IDE. If you already have python 3 installed on your PC you can save it in notepad and run it through cmd.
I will update this more once I have tested this on another windows computer to then convert it too .exe
I would really love to create a icon image for the shortcut .exe file. That would look pretty cool but this mouse jiggler is amazing, something so simple right?
